## **Twitter Hate Speech & Abusive Language Detection and Moderation Classifier**

# **Goal Of This Project** 
Our goal is to create a binary classification model that detects slang words or hate speech so that these tweets should be deleted automatically. 

# **Dataset Description**

- **Content**: Tweets categorized into hate speech, offensive language, and neither.
- **Purpose**: To train and evaluate models for detecting hate speech and offensive content on social media.
- **Data Source**: Twitter tweets, annotated for various types of abusive language.
- **Format**: CSV files with labeled examples for supervised learning tasks.
